feedback that users provide through their choices (e.g., clicks, purchases) is one of the most common types of data readily avail able for training search and recommendation algorithms. However, myopically training systems based on choice data may only improve short-term engagement, but not the long-term sustainability of the platform and the long-term benefits to its users, content providers, and other stakeholders. In this paper, we thus develop a new framework in which decision makers (e.g., platform operators, regulators, users) can express long-term goals for the behavior of the platform (e.g., fairness, revenue distribution, legal requirements). These goals take the form of exposure or impact targets that go well beyond individual sessions, and we provide new control-based algorithms to achieve these goals. In particular, the controllers are designed to achieve the stated long-term goals with minimum impact on shortterm engagement. Beyond the principled theoretical derivation of the controllers, we evaluate the algorithms on both synthetic and real-world data. While all controllers perform well, we find that they provide interesting trade-offs in efficiency, robustness, and the ability to plan ahead.},\n  url={https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04923},\n  note={}\n}\n\n@inproceedings{brantley2023interactive,\n  title={Interactive Text Generation},\n  author={Faltings, Felix and Galley, Michel and Brantley, Kianté and Peng, Baolin and Cai, Weixin and Zhang, Yizhe and Gao, Jianfeng and Dolan, William B},\n  booktitle=long-EMNLP,\n  shorttitle=EMNLP,\n  pages={4450--4468},\n  year={2023},\n  abstract={Users interact with text, image, code, or other editors on a daily basis. However, machine learning models are rarely trained in the settings that reflect the interactivity between users and their editor. This is understandable as training AI models with real users is not only slow and costly, but what these models learn may be specific to user interface design choices. Unfortunately, this means most of the research on text, code, and image generation has focused on non-interactive settings, whereby the model is expected to get everything right without ac- counting for any input from a user who may be willing to help. We introduce a new Interactive Text Generation task that allows training generation models interactively without the costs of involving real users, by using user simulators that provide edits that guide the model towards a given target text. We train our interactive models using Imitation Learning, and our ex- periments against competitive non-interactive generation models show that models trained interactively are superior to their non-interactive counterparts, even when all models are given the same budget of user inputs or edits.},\n  url={https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00908},\n  note={}\n}\n\n@inproceedings{brantley2023reinforcement,\n  title={Is Reinforcement Learning (Not) for Natural Language Processing: Benchmarks, Baselines, and Building Blocks for Natural Language Policy Optimization},\n  author={Ramamurthy, Rajkumar and Ammanabrolu, Prithviraj and Brantley, Kianté and Hessel, Jack and Sifa, Rafet and Bauckhage, Christian and Hajishirzi, Hannaneh and Choi, Yejin},\n  booktitle=long-ICLR,\n  shorttitle=ICLR,\n  year={2023},\n  abstract={We tackle the problem of aligning pre-trained large language models (LMs) with human preferences. If we view text generation as a sequential decision-making problem, reinforcement learning (RL) appears to be a natural conceptual framework. However, using RL for LM-based generation faces empirical challenges, including training instability due to the combinatorial action space, as well as a lack of opensource libraries and benchmarks customized for LM alignment. Thus, a question rises in the research community: is RL a practical paradigm for NLP? To help answer this, we first introduce an open-source modular library, RL4LMs, for optimizing language generators with RL. The library consists of on-policy RL algorithms that can be used to train any encoder or encoder-decoder LM in the HuggingFace library (Wolf et al., 2020) with an arbitrary reward function. Next, we present the GRUE (General Reinforced-language Understanding Evaluation) benchmark, a set of 6 language generation tasks which are supervised not by target strings, but by reward functions which capture automated measures of human preference. GRUE is the first leaderboard-style evaluation of RL algorithms for NLP tasks. Finally, we introduce an easy-to-use, performant RL algorithm, NLPO (Natural Language Policy Optimization) that learns to effectively reduce the combinatorial action space in language generation. We show 1) that RL techniques are generally better than supervised methods at aligning LMs to human preferences; and 2) that NLPO exhibits greater stability and performance than previous policy gradient methods (e.g., PPO (Schulman et al., 2017)), based on both automatic and human evaluations.},\n  url={https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01241},\n  note={Spotlight},\n}\n\n@inproceedings{brantley2024coactive,\n  title={Coactive Learning for Large Language Models using Implicit User Feedback},\n  author={Tucker, Aaron David and Brantley, Kianté and Cahall, Adam and Joachims, Thorsten},\n  booktitle=long-ICML,\n  shorttitle=ICML,\n  year={2024},\n  abstract={We propose coactive learning as a model and feedback mechanism for training large language models (LLMs).

Follow-up work such as ValueDICE tackles this issue by deriving a fully off-policy AIL objective. Instead in this work, we develop a novel and principled AIL algorithm via the framework of boosting. Like boosting, our new algorithm, AILBoost, maintains an ensemble of weighted weak learners (i.e., policies) and trains a discriminator that witnesses the maximum discrepancy between the distributions of the ensemble and the expert policy. We maintain a weighted replay buffer to represent the state-action distribution induced by the ensemble, allowing us to train discriminators using the entire data collected so far. Empirically, we evaluate our algorithm on both controller state-based and pixel-based environments from the DeepMind Control Suite. AILBoost outperforms DAC on both types of environments, demonstrating the benefit of properly weighting replay buffer data for off-policy training.

Current state-of-the-art text retrieval models leverage pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to achieve competitive performance, but training LLM-based retrievers via typical contrastive losses requires intricate heuristics, including selecting hard negatives and using additional supervision as learning signals. This reliance on heuristics stems from the fact that the contrastive loss itself is heuristic and does not directly optimize the downstream metrics of decision quality at the end of the processing pipeline. To address this issue, we introduce Neural PG-RANK, a novel training algorithm that learns to rank by instantiating a LLM as a Plackett-Luce ranking policy. Neural PG-RANK provides a principled method for end-to-end training of retrieval models as part of larger decision systems via policy gradient, with little reliance on complex heuristics, and it effectively unifies the training objective with downstream decision-making quality. We conduct extensive experiments on various text retrieval benchmarks. The results demonstrate that when the training objective aligns with the evaluation setup, Neural PG-RANK yields remarkable in-domain performance improvement, with substantial out-of-domain generalization to some critical datasets employed in downstream question answering tasks.},\n  url={https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04407},\n  keywords={workshop},\n}\n\n@inproceedings{brantley2023learning,\n  title={Learning to Generate Better Than Your LLM},\n  author={Chang, Jonathan and Brantley, Kianté and Ramamurthy, Rajkumar, and Misra, Dipendra, and Sun, Wen},\n  booktitle={NeurIPS 2023 Workshop on Instruction Tuning and Instruction Following},\n  shorttitle={NeurIPS 2023 Workshop on Instruction Tuning and Instruction Following},\n  year={2023},\n  abstract={Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) for text generation.

They also form a natural bridge between model-based and model-free RL methods: like the former they make predictions about future experiences, and like the latter they allow efficient prediction of total discounted rewards. However, successor-style representations are not optimized to generalize across policies: typically, we maintain a limited-length list of policies, and share information among them by representation learning or GPI\\@. Successor-style representations also typically make no provision for gathering information or reasoning about latent variables. To address these limitations, we bring together ideas from predictive state representations, belief space value iteration, successor features, and convex analysis: we develop a new, general successor-style representation, together with a Bellman equation that connects multiple sources of information within this representation, including different latent states, policies, and reward functions. The new representation is highly expressive: for example, it lets us efficiently read off an optimal policy for a new reward function, or a policy that imitates a new demonstration. For this paper, we focus on exact computation of the new representation in small, known environments, since even this restricted setting offers plenty of interesting questions. Our implementation does not scale to large, unknown environments --- nor would we expect it to, since it generalizes POMDP value iteration, which is difficult to scale. However, we believe that future work will allow us to extend our ideas to approximate reasoning in large, unknown environments. We conduct experiments to explore which of the potential barriers to scaling are most pressing.},\n  url={https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.02650},\n}\n\n@inproceedings{brantley2020active,\n  title={Active Imitation Learning with Noisy Guidance},\n  author={Brantley, Kianté and Sharaf, Amr and Daumé III, Hal},\n  booktitle=long-ACL,\n  shorttitle=ACL,\n  pages={2093--2105},\n  year={2020},\n  abstract={Imitation learning algorithms provide state-of-the-art results on many structured prediction tasks by learning near-optimal search policies.

To combat this query complexity, we consider an active learning setting in which the learning algorithm has additional access to a much cheaper noisy heuristic that provides noisy guidance. Our algorithm, LEAQI, learns a difference classifier that predicts when the expert is likely to disagree with the heuristic, and queries the expert only when necessary.

In this paper, we propose an algorithmic scheme that can handle a wide class of constraints in RL tasks: specifically, any constraints that require expected values of some vector measurements (such as the use of an action) to lie in a convex set. This captures previously studied constraints (such as safety and proximity to an expert), but also enables new classes of constraints (such as diversity). Our approach comes with rigorous theoretical guarantees and only relies on the ability to approximately solve standard RL tasks. As a result, it can be easily adapted to work with any model-free or model-based RL. In our experiments, we show that it matches previous algorithms that enforce safety via constraints, but can also enforce new properties that these algorithms do not incorporate, such as diversity.},\n  url={https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.09323},\n}\n\n@inproceedings{brantley2017umd,\n  title={The UMD Neural Machine Translation Systems at WMT17 Bandit Learning Task},\n  author={Sharaf, Amr and Feng, Shi and Nguyen, Khanh and Brantley, Kianté and Daumé III, Hal},\n  booktitle={Proceedings of the Second Conference on Machine Translation},\n  shorttitle={Proceedings of the Second Conference on Machine Translation},\n  pages={667--673},\n  year={2017},\n  abstract={We describe the University of Maryland machine translation systems submitted to the WMT17 German-English Bandit Learning Task.

We derive a procedure that can propagate restrictions on SCM parameters through the SCM’s graph structure to other parameters that we are trying to learn. The propagated restrictions then enable more efficient learning (i.e., transfer). By analyzing the procedure, we are able to challenge widely-held beliefs about transfer learning. First, we show that having sparse changes across environments is neither necessary nor sufficient for transfer. Second, we show an example where the common heuristic of freezing a layer in a network causes poor transfer performance.

In this work, to optimize text-to-image generative models for task specific rewards and enable fast training and inference, we propose a framework for fine-tuning consistency models via RL. Our framework, called Reinforcement Learning for Consistency Model (RLCM), frames the iterative inference process of a consistency model as an RL procedure. RLCM improves upon RL fine-tuned diffusion models on text-to-image generation capabilities and trades computation during inference time for sample quality.

Comparing to RL finetuned diffusion models, RLCM trains significantly faster, improves the quality of the generation measured under the reward objectives, and speeds up the inference procedure by generating high quality images with as few as two inference steps.

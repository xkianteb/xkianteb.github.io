  I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Kempner Institute and School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS), Harvard University. I study imitation learning and interactive learningâ€”or, more broadly, settings that involve a feedback loop between a machine learning agent and the input the machine learning agent sees.

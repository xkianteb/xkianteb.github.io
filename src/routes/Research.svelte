  I'm an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Harvard SEAS where I lead the Data-Centric Machine Learning       (DCML) group. I'm also an Associate Faculty at the Kempner Institute, and have affiliations with the Center for       Research on Computation and Society and the Harvard Data Science Initiative. I am also a researcher at Microsoft      Research New England.

  A professor named Hal Daumé III (he/him). He wields appointments in Computer Science where he is a Volpi-Cupal      Professor, as well as Language Science at UMD where he leads the TRAILS, the Institute for Trustworthy AI in Law &    Society (in Spring 2024 he's teaching a gen-ed course You and I, and Generative AI; past: Trustworthy ML (F23), AI    (S23), Human-AI Interaction (F22), Just ML (F21)); he is also a Senior Principal Researcher the machine learning and  fairness groups at Microsoft Research NYC. He and his wonderful advisees like to study questions related to how to    get machines to becomes more adept at human language (and artificial intelligence tasks more broadly), by developing  models and algorithms that allow them to learn from data. (Keywords: natural language processing and machine learning.) The two major questions that really drive their research these days are:

      (1) how can we get computers to learn
              through natural interaction with people/users?

              and (2) how can we do this in a way that minimize harms
                      in the learned models?

  Kianté Brantley is a Postdoctoral scholar at Cornell working with Thorsten Joachims. He completed his Ph.D. in      computer science at the University of Maryland College Park (UMD) advised by Professor Hal Daumé III. Brantley        designs algorithms that efficiently integrate domain knowledge into sequential decision-making problems. He is most   excited about imitation learning and interactive learning—or, more broadly, settings that involve a feedback loop     between a machine learning agent and the input the machine learning agent sees.

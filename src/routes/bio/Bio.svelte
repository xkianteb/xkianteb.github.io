  Kianté Brantley is a Assistant Professor at<br><br>
  Postdoctoral Associate in the Department of Computer Science at Cornell University., working with Thorsten Joachims. He completed his Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Maryland College Park, advised by Dr. Hal Daumé III. His research focuses on developing machine learning models that can make automated decisions in the real world with minimal supervision. His research lies at the intersection of imitation learning, reinforcement learning, and natural language processing. He is a recipient of the NSF LSAMP BD Fellowship, ACM SIGHPC Computational and Data Science Fellowship, Microsoft Dissertation Research Grant, Ann G. Wylie Dissertation Fellowship, and NSF CIFellow Postdoctoral Fellowship.<br><br>

  Hal Daumé is a Volpi-Cupal endowed Professor of Computer Science and Language Science at the University of Maryland, where he leads TRAILS , an NSF & NIST-funded institute on Trustworthy AI; he is also a Senior Principal Researcher at Microsoft Research NYC. His research focus is on developing natural language processing systems that interact naturally with people, promote their self-efficacy, while mitigating societal harms. Together with his students and colleagues, he has received several awards, including best paper at AACL 2022, ACL 2018, NAACL 2016, CEAS 2011 and ECML 2009, test of time award at ACL 2022 (and nomination at ACL 2017), and best demo at NeurIPS 2015. He has been program chair for ICML 2020 (together with Aarti Singh) and for NAACL 2013 (together with Katrin Kirchhoff), and he was an inaugural diversity and inclusion co-chair at NeurIPS 2018 (with Katherine Heller). When not sciencing and teaching, he spends most of his time climbing, yogaing, cooking, backpacking, skiing, and biking.
